# Dynapp Maven Plugin

The plugin handles installing dalvik compiled jars to the android devices. The system converts java specific code to android specific code and moves it onto the selected ADB devices. This requires the device is in developer mode, the device has USB debugging enabled, and the computer has ADB installed. The module was built on maven 2.0. There are many configuration options based off personal preference. 

##Setup
### How to enable developer mode?
  1. Find the Android Build number in Settings
![The screens of where the build number is generally found](http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/07/buildnumber-100361660-large.idge.png)
  2. How to reach the build number on popular devices
    - **Stock Android**: Settings > About phone > Build number
    - **LG**: Settings > About phone > Software information > Build number 
    - **HTC One (M8)**: Settings > About > Software information > More > Build number
  3. Once youâ€™ve found the Build number section of the settings, tap on the section 7 times. After two taps, a small pop up notification should appear saying "you are now X steps away from being a developer" with a number that counts down with every additional tap.

### How to enable ADB debugging?
 1. Go into developer options *(Covered in the previous question on how enable developer mode)*
 2. Check USB Debugging

 4. Connect to the Computer through a micro usb.
 
### How to install ADB on my computer?
*This will not cover the logistics of installing [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) however you can go to the link attached to install it on your operating system. *
